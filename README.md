This simple program does a rainbow attack!
How it works?
It takes a csv file which contains some usernames and their hashed passwords (passwords are 4-digit numbers which have been hashed with sha-256).
Then it gives you a csv file which contains usernames and their original passwords.
Just put your input and ouput csv files path in function arguments.
